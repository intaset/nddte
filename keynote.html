  <p class="body">Serena Mazzucchelli, PhD, is assistant professor in Biochemistry at the University of Milan. She received her bachelor degree in Biological Sciences in 2004, master degree in Biology in 2006 and PhD in Biological Sciences in 2009 at the Department of Biotechnology and Biosciences (University of Milan-Bicocca-Italy). From 2009 to 2012 she did a post-doc position at the Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences “L. Sacco” (University of Milan-Italy). From 2012 to 2015 she has been researcher at the Nanomedicine Unit of the “L. Sacco” University Hospital. Today, SM is a fixed-term researcher at the Nanomedicine laboratory of the University of Milan carrying out her research activity focused on the development of nanodevices for diagnosis and therapy of breast cancer at the Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences “L. Sacco”. SM is author of 37 paper in peer-review journals.</p>

  <p class="body">Prof Moganavelli Singh graduated with a PhD in Biochemistry from the University of KwaZulu-Natal in 2006. She is currently an Associate Professor, Researcher and Head of the Non-Viral Gene and Drug Delivery Laboratory at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa. Her research interests are interdisciplinary, and include the development and biological evaluation of novel non-viral (polymeric, lipid and inorganic) nanoparticles as potential gene and drug delivery vehicles for cancer gene therapy. Among the nanoparticles currently under evaluation in her laboratory are gold, silver, selenium, and magnetic iron  nanoparticles. In addition she is also involved in the evaluation of the anti-cancer activities of chemically synthesized and medicinal plant compounds. </p>
