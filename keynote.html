  <p class="body">Prof. Hiorth has 15 years of experience working within the field of drug delivery and has a special interest in the use of biopolymers such as chitosan, pectin and alginate. She is the leader of the SiteDel Group at the School of Pharmacy at the University of Oslo in Norway. The SiteDel group is an interdisciplinary research group working within the field of formulation, pharmaceutical technology and polymer chemistry. She is also the project leader of the project “Development of advanced nanoparticulate drug delivery systems for protective functions of the teeth” granted by the Research Council of Norway (2013). This project aims for new advanced nanodrug delivery systems for dental delivery and important collaborators in the project are researchers in the area of clinical dentistry and physicians working with bioimpedance. She has extended experience both in physico-chemical characterization of the biopolymers used for producing different formulations such as gels, coatings, pellets and nanoparticles and for the development and production of the formulations. Important parameters for characterizing the products, especially the nanoparticles spans from size determinations, zeta potential, compactness and the bioadhesive properties of the particles. Her field of interest has developed from colon drug delivery towards drug delivery to the oral cavity and especially by the use of nanoparticles; both polymer- and lipid based (primarily liposomes).</p>

  <p class="keynote-topic"><b>Topic of Keynote:</b> Can Locally Administered Nanoparticles Revolutionize the Treatment of the Oral Cavity?</p>

  <p class="body">Prof. Jampilek has 17 years of experience in the field of drug design and discovery of especially potential antibacterial/antimycobacterial, antifungal, antiprotozoal drugs and also potential pesticides. During 7-year period of working in expert and managerial posts in the R&D division of a pharmaceutical company, he also obtained experience in the field of drug polymorphism, solid-state analytical techniques, evaluation of physicochemical properties of drugs, ADME and drug bioavailability as well as in design of new intestinal absorption promoters, transdermal permeation enhancers and synthesis of nanoparticles. Now he is a leader of the research group dealing with design of new antimicrobials and investigation/modifications of bioavailability of drugs at the Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences in Brno, Czech Republic. This is an interdisciplinary research group working in the fields of design of original compounds, organic synthesis, screening of biological effects, investigation of physicochemical properties and permeability through skin, PAMPA and BBB, structure-activity relationships and preparation and characterization of nanoparticles/nanoformulations of drugs. This research group cooperates with many external teams not only from the Czech Republic, but also, for example, from Slovakia, Poland, Ireland, UK, USA, Argentina, Australia, India and China.</p>
