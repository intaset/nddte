  <p class="body">Prof. Jampilek has 17 years of experience in the field of drug design and discovery of especially potential antibacterial/antimycobacterial, antifungal, antiprotozoal drugs and also potential pesticides. During 7-year period of working in expert and managerial posts in the R&D division of a pharmaceutical company, he also obtained experience in the field of drug polymorphism, solid-state analytical techniques, evaluation of physicochemical properties of drugs, ADME and drug bioavailability as well as in design of new intestinal absorption promoters, transdermal permeation enhancers and synthesis of nanoparticles. Now he is a leader of the research group dealing with design of new antimicrobials and investigation/modifications of bioavailability of drugs at the Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences in Brno, Czech Republic. This is an interdisciplinary research group working in the fields of design of original compounds, organic synthesis, screening of biological effects, investigation of physicochemical properties and permeability through skin, PAMPA and BBB, structure-activity relationships and preparation and characterization of nanoparticles/nanoformulations of drugs. This research group cooperates with many external teams not only from the Czech Republic, but also, for example, from Slovakia, Poland, Ireland, UK, USA, Argentina, Australia, India and China.</p>
